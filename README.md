DocuScope: Computer-aided Rhetorical Analysis - Carnegie Mellon University was created by David Kaufer and Suguru Ishizaki in the Department of English at Carnegie Mellon University:

DocuScope is a text analysis environment with a suite of interactive visualization tools for corpus-based rhetorical analysis. [â€¦] David created a generic (default) dictionary, consisting of over 40 million linguistic patterns of English classified into over 100 categories of rhetorical effects. Suguru designed and implemented the analysis and visualization software, which can annotate a corpus of text against any dictionary of regular strings that are classified into a hierarchy of rhetorical effects.
While prior versions of Docuscope are proprietary, a revision of 3.21 has recently been made open-source and available to the public. You can download it here from GitHub.https://github.com/docuscope/DocuScope-Dictionary-June-26-2012
